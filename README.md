# Login_logger
A logging solution to track user logins on a Linux servers. The system monitors user logins and logs their usernames, IP addresses, and login timestamps into an SQLite3 database. The logger runs as a systemd service for continuous operation.

## Features
- Tracks usernames, IP addresses, and login times.
- Logs data into an SQLite3 database.
- Runs continuously in the background as a systemd service.
- Uses a default database location: /var/log/user_login_logger/user_login_logger.db

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Linux system with systemd support.
- Python 3 installed.
### Python Libraries
- sqlite3 (included with Python 3).
- subprocess (included with Python 3).

## Setup Instructions
### Step 1: Create the SQLite3 Database
Create the database directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/user_login_logger
sudo chmod 755 /var/log/user_login_logger
```
Create the SQLite3 database:

``` bash
sqlite3 /var/log/user_login_logger/user_login_logger.db
```
Inside the SQLite prompt, create the logins table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE logins (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT NOT NULL,
    ip_address TEXT NOT NULL,
    login_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
Exit the SQLite prompt:

```bash
.exit
```
### Step 2: Place the Python Script
Save the Python script (provided separately) to /usr/local/bin and ensure it is executable:

Copy the script to the correct location:

```bash
sudo cp log_user_data.py /usr/local/bin/log_user_data.py
```
Make the script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/log_user_data.py
```
### Step 3: Create the Systemd Service
Create a new systemd service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/log_user_data.service
```
Add the following configuration:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=User Login Logger Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/log_user_data.py
Restart=always
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/var/log/user_login_logger
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Reload systemd to recognize the new service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
Enable the service to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable log_user_data.service
```
Start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start log_user_data.service
```
## Usage
###Check Service Status
To check if the service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status log_user_data.service
```
### View Logs
To view logs generated by the service:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u log_user_data.service
```
### Query the Database
To view logged user data, use the SQLite3 command-line tool:

```bash
sqlite3 /var/log/user_login_logger/user_login_logger.db "SELECT * FROM logins;"
```
## Troubleshooting
### Script Debugging
Run the script manually to check for errors:

```bash
python3 /usr/local/bin/log_user_data.py
```
### Service Logs
If the service fails to start, check systemd logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u log_user_data.service
```
### Database Permissions
Ensure the database directory and file have appropriate permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/log/user_login_logger
```
### No Logins Detected
Check the output of the who command to ensure users are actively logging in:

```bash
who
```
## Configuration Notes
Database Location:

- The SQLite3 database is located at /var/log/user_login_logger/user_login_logger.db.
### Polling Interval:

The script polls for new logins every 10 seconds. To adjust this, modify the time.sleep(10) line in the Python script.
### Customization:

This setup uses /var/log/user_login_logger as the default directory for storing logs. You can change this directory in the Python script (db_path variable) and service file (WorkingDirectory).
